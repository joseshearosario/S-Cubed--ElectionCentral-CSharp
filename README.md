S-Cubed--ElectionCentral-CSharp
===============================

IMPORTANT: This program is being published AS-IS

The purpose of this program is to hodl voter records and allow those who are registered to vote in elections. In addition, the results of the eledction will be stored and eventually released to determine who has won.

An executable application file is located in \Voting\bin\Debug, which will open a command prompt.

Currently, what is available is the option to register a voter and vote in a pre-programmed election. The user is not able to register an already registerd voter, and duplicates are avoided when it comes to the ballot.

Updates will include requiring you to be registerd before you vote, file input of pre-defined voters and ballots, and the recording of voting results in a text file.
